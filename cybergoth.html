  <p>Cyber Goths are a little more radical than some other
    types when it comes to fashion, and very different in
    music taste and general aesthetics. Unlike a Trad Goth
    or a Romantic Goth, these Goths love techno and industrial
    music )possibly bands like Rammstein, Asphyxia or Angelspit),
    love advanced technology (hence "Cyber" Goth), and are usually
    more energetic people due to their love of techno/dance music.
    Some believe this type evolved from Industrial music and fashion,
    adopting a darker theme that linked them to the Goth subculture,
    typical choices in music being a little too dark or morbid for
    the average dance fan. They're definitely unique, and a blow to
    the typical stereotypes that say all Goths have to be depressed
     and wearing only black.</p>
