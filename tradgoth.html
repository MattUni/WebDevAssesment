  <p>"Trad" is short for "Traditional". These Goths were the first to
    come about, setting the stage for all kinds of spooky variants later
     on. Starting out in the 80's with the music group, Trad Goths
   started setting the scene in stone as they attended concerts of bands
    like Bauhaus, The Cure, and Siouxsie and the Banshees in thetypical color;
     black. (And other colors. There's no rule that said a Goth had to dress
     in black only!) </p>
