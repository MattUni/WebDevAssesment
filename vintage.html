  <p>A Gothic accent comes to more 1950's styles with the Gothabilly
     type. This type was inspired by throwing Goth traits onto the
    Rockabilly and Psychobilly scenes, which were combinations of
    rock and country, or "hillbilly" music. Thus, Goth and
    Rockabilly/Psychobilly came together, in music and in fashion,
    to create the Gothabilly. The type also links to a Goth cousin,
    Deathrock, since there's heavy amounts of love for horror and
    dark humor. Goth rock is blended with the blues and country, a
    less aggressive form of one of its inspirations, psychobilly.
    There's that old retro rock n' roll feel in Gothabilly, along
    with the dark and morbid tendencies that draw many people in
    the subculture to this type.</p>
