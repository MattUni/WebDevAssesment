  <p>Also sometimes known as Gothic Lolita, J-Goth is a type of Gothic
     movement in Japan that spun off the Lolita styles they already had.
      In the picture above, Kanon Wakeshima, a pop artist and cellist,
      enjoys wearing Gothic Lolita style clothing. She was produced by
      Mana, a former member of the visual-kei 80's band Malice Mizer.
      People would say that he's responsible for the style. Visual-kei
      bands are bands that focus on drastic appearances around as much
      as their music, whether they're hardcore like Dir en Grey or
      softer like Malice Mizer. These bands typically like to blend
       Goth, Punk, and other elements into their appearance and many
      will try to look more feminine. These fashion choices
       helped spur the Lolita movement along. Gothic Lolita,
      or J-Goth, is debated as a type, but has close ties
       and relations to the style due to the black, ruffled,
       lacy dreses and accessories. </p>
