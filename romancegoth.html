  <p>Romantic Goths are pretty different from other types of Goth,
    like Cyber or Traditional.These Goths focus on the beautiful, dark things in life,
     Things like dead roses, graveyards lit by the moonlight, ravens,
     all might be beautiful to this type. Typically, they're deep-thinkers,
    very creative and have a tendency to daydream, They're a passionate
    people that usually love the drama of romance and sorrow.
    Along with those darker, slightly more morbid aesthetics,
    the Romantic Goths prefer softer music than others might.
     Classical music, bands like Dark Sanctuary and Nightwish
     may appeal to them. The brooding mood is what's more likely to draw
    them in.</p>
